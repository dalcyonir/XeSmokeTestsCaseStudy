#Usage
the tests are ran with the command mvn clean test
maven surefire is used in order for the tests to be easy to be used in a CI/CD context (like through Jenkins)

#Notes
Tests run serially but can also be ran in parallel.
The search values that are hardcoded (eg. Pagkrati and the prices/area) should be gathered from a database
if the tests need to be extended.
